## Features
- **Realistic Traffic Simulation**: Simulate multiple vehicles and their behavior at intersections, traffic signals, and lane changes.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Roads and intersections can be configured to model different traffic scenarios.
- **User Interface**: Interactive UI built using JavaFX to visualize the traffic simulation.

## Upcoming Features to experiment
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust settings like vehicle speed, traffic signal duration, and more.
- **A more usable Interface**: Honestly the UI is kinda ugly and hard to design. Will work on a more basic and usable User Interface.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 11 or later**
- **Maven 3.6 or later**
